# Coverlet Integration with VSTest


| Entry point | How will code coverage be enabled? | Syntax                                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|dotnet test CLI              | Through a switch to condition data collection | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`   |
|dotnet vstest CLI            | Through a switch to condition data collection | `dotnet vstest --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` |

NB. If you're using `dotnet vstest` you MUST `publish` your test project before i.e.
```bash
C:\project
dotnet publish
...
  vstest -> C:\project\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\testdll.dll
  vstest -> C:\project\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\publish\
...
dotnet vstest C:\project\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\publish\testdll.dll --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Coverlet Options Supported with VSTest

#### Default
| Option | Summary |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
|Format              | Results format in which coverage output is generated. Default format is cobertura.| 

#### Advanced Options (Supported via runsettings)
These are a list of options that are supported by coverlet. These can be specified as datacollector configurations in the runsettings.

| Option         | Summary                                                                                  |
|-------------   |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Format          | Coverage output format. These are either cobertura, json, lcov, opencover or teamcity as well as combinations of these formats.   | 
|MergeWith       | Combine the output of multiple coverage runs into a single result([check the sample](Examples.md)).                       | 
|Exclude         | Exclude from code coverage analysing using filter expressions.                           | 
|ExcludeByFile   | Ignore specific source files from code coverage.                                         | 
|Include         | Explicitly set what to include in code coverage analysis using filter expressions.       | 
|IncludeDirectory| Explicitly set which directories to include in code coverage analysis.                   |
|SingleHit       | Specifies whether to limit code coverage hit reporting to a single hit for each location.| 
|UseSourceLink   | Specifies whether to use SourceLink URIs in place of file system paths.                  |

How to specify these options via runsettings?
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<RunSettings>
  <DataCollectionRunSettings>
    <DataCollectors>
      <DataCollector friendlyName="XPlat code coverage">
        <Configuration>
          <Format>json,cobertura</Format>
          <MergeWith>/custom/path/result.json</MergeWith>
          <Exclude>[coverlet.*.tests?]*,[*]Coverlet.Core*</Exclude> <!-- [Assembly-Filter]Type-Filter -->
          <Include>[coverlet.*]*,[*]Coverlet.Core*</Include> <!-- [Assembly-Filter]Type-Filter -->
          <ExcludeByAttribute>Obsolete,GeneratedCodeAttribute,CompilerGeneratedAttribute</ExcludeByAttribute>
          <ExcludeByFile>../dir1/class1.cs,../dir2/*.cs,../dir3/**/*.cs,</ExcludeByFile> <!-- Absolute or relative file paths -->
          <IncludeDirectory>../dir1/,../dir2/,</IncludeDirectory>
          <SingleHit>false</SingleHit>
          <UseSourceLink>true</UseSourceLink>
        </Configuration>
      </DataCollector>
    </DataCollectors>
  </DataCollectionRunSettings>
</RunSettings>
```
This runsettings file can easily be provided using command line option as given :

1. `dotnet test --settings coverletArgs.runsettings`

2. `dotnet vstest --settings coverletArgs.runsettings`

## Implementation Details

The proposed solution is implemented with the help of [datacollectors](https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/master/docs/extensions/datacollector.md).

1. Outproc Datacollector : The outproc collector would always run in a separate process(datacollector.exe/datacollector.dll) than the process in which tests are being executed(testhost*.exe/testhost.dll). This datacollector would be responsible for calling into coverlet APIs for instrumenting dlls, collecting coverage results and sending the coverage output file back to test platform.

2. Inproc Datacollector : The inproc collector in the testhost process executing the tests. This collector will be needed to remove the dependency on the exit handler to flush the hit files.

The datacollectors will be bundled as a separate NuGet package, the reference to which will be added by default in the .NET Core test templates, thus making it the default solution for collecting code coverage for .NET core projects.
