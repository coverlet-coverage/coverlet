# Coverlet Integration with MSBuild

In this mode, Coverlet doesn't require any additional setup other than including the NuGet package in the unit test project. It integrates with the `dotnet test` infrastructure built into the .NET Core CLI and when enabled, will automatically generate coverage results after tests are run.

If a property takes multiple comma-separated values please note that [you will have to add escaped quotes around the string](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2999#issuecomment-366078677) like this: `/p:Exclude=\"[coverlet.*]*,[*]Coverlet.Core*\"`, `/p:Include=\"[coverlet.*]*,[*]Coverlet.Core*\"`, or `/p:CoverletOutputFormat=\"json,opencover\"`.

## Code Coverage

Enabling code coverage is as simple as setting the `CollectCoverage` property to `true`

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true
```

After the above command is run, a `coverage.json` file containing the results will be generated in the root directory of the test project. A summary of the results will also be displayed in the terminal.

## Coverage Output

Coverlet can generate coverage results in multiple formats, which is specified using the `CoverletOutputFormat` property. For example, the following command emits coverage results in the `opencover` format:

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
```

Supported Formats:

* json (default)
* lcov
* opencover
* cobertura
* teamcity

You can specify multiple output formats by separating them with a comma (`,`).

The output of the coverage result can be specified using the `CoverletOutput` property.

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutput='./result.json'
```

To specify a directory where all results will be written to (especially if using multiple formats), end the value with a `/`.

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutput='./results/'
```

### TeamCity Output

Coverlet can output basic code coverage statistics using [TeamCity service messages](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD18/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-ServiceMessages).

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=teamcity
```

The currently supported [TeamCity statistics](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD18/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-ServiceMessages) are:

| TeamCity Statistic Key  | Description                    |
| :---                    | :---                           |
| CodeCoverageL           | Line-level code coverage       |
| CodeCoverageB           | Branch-level code coverage     |
| CodeCoverageM           | Method-level code coverage     |
| CodeCoverageAbsLTotal   | The total number of lines      |
| CodeCoverageAbsLCovered | The number of covered lines    |
| CodeCoverageAbsBTotal   | The total number of branches   |
| CodeCoverageAbsBCovered | The number of covered branches |
| CodeCoverageAbsMTotal   | The total number of methods    |
| CodeCoverageAbsMCovered | The number of covered methods  |

## Merging Results

With Coverlet you can combine the output of multiple coverage runs into a single result.

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:MergeWith='/path/to/result.json'
```

The value given to `/p:MergeWith` **must** be a path to Coverlet's own json result format. The results in `result.json` will be read, and added to the new results written to by Coverlet.
[Check the sample](Examples.md).

## Threshold

Coverlet allows you to specify a coverage threshold below which it fails the build. This allows you to enforce a minimum coverage percent on all changes to your project.

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:Threshold=80
```

The above command will automatically fail the build if the line, branch or method coverage of _any_ of the instrumented modules falls below 80%. You can specify what type of coverage to apply the threshold value to using the `ThresholdType` property. For example to apply the threshold check to only **line** coverage:

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:Threshold=80 /p:ThresholdType=line
```

You can specify multiple values for `ThresholdType` by separating them with commas. Valid values include `line`, `branch` and `method`.

By default, Coverlet will validate the threshold value against the coverage result of each module. The `/p:ThresholdStat` option allows you to change this behaviour and can have any of the following values:

* Minimum (Default): Ensures the coverage result of each module isn't less than the threshold
* Total: Ensures the total combined coverage result of all modules isn't less than the threshold
* Average: Ensures the average coverage result of all modules isn't less than the threshold

The following command will compare the threshold value with the overall total coverage of all modules:

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:Threshold=80 /p:ThresholdType=line /p:ThresholdStat=total
```

## Excluding From Coverage

### Attributes

You can ignore a method an entire class or assembly from code coverage by creating and applying the `ExcludeFromCodeCoverage` attribute present in the `System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis` namespace.

You can also ignore additional attributes by using the `ExcludeByAttribute` property (short name or full name supported):

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:ExcludeByAttribute="Obsolete,GeneratedCodeAttribute,CompilerGeneratedAttribute"
```

### Source Files
You can also ignore specific source files from code coverage using the `ExcludeByFile` property
 - Use single or multiple paths (separate by comma)
 - Use absolute or relative paths (relative to the project directory)
 - Use file path or directory path with globbing (e.g `dir1/*.cs`)

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:ExcludeByFile=\"../dir1/class1.cs,../dir2/*.cs,../dir3/**/*.cs\"
```

### Filters
Coverlet gives the ability to have fine grained control over what gets excluded using "filter expressions".

Syntax: `/p:Exclude=[Assembly-Filter]Type-Filter`

Wildcards
- `*` => matches zero or more characters
- `?` => the prefixed character is optional

Examples
 - `/p:Exclude="[*]*"` => Excludes all types in all assemblies (nothing is instrumented)
 - `/p:Exclude="[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage"` => Excludes the Coverage class in the `Coverlet.Core` namespace belonging to any assembly that matches `coverlet.*` (e.g `coverlet.core`)
 - `/p:Exclude="[*]Coverlet.Core.Instrumentation.*"` => Excludes all types belonging to `Coverlet.Core.Instrumentation` namespace in any assembly
 - `/p:Exclude="[coverlet.*.tests?]*"` => Excludes all types in any assembly starting with `coverlet.` and ending with `.test` or `.tests` (the `?` makes the `s`  optional)
 - `/p:Exclude=\"[coverlet.*]*,[*]Coverlet.Core*\"` => Excludes assemblies matching `coverlet.*` and excludes all types belonging to the `Coverlet.Core` namespace in any assembly

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:Exclude="[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage"
```

Coverlet goes a step in the other direction by also letting you explicitly set what can be included using the `Include` property.

Examples
 - `/p:Include="[*]*"` => Includes all types in all assemblies (everything is instrumented)
 - `/p:Include="[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage"` => Includes the Coverage class in the `Coverlet.Core` namespace belonging to any assembly that matches `coverlet.*` (e.g `coverlet.core`)
  - `/p:Include="[coverlet.*.tests?]*"` => Includes all types in any assembly starting with `coverlet.` and ending with `.test` or `.tests` (the `?` makes the `s`  optional)

Both `Exclude` and `Include` properties can be used together but `Exclude` takes precedence. You can specify multiple filter expressions by separting them with a comma (`,`).

You can also include coverage of the test assembly itself by setting `/p:IncludeTestAssembly` to `true`.

### Note for Powershell / VSTS users
To exclude or include multiple assemblies when using Powershell scripts or creating a .yaml file for a VSTS build ```%2c``` should be used as a separator. Msbuild will translate this symbol to ```,```.

```/p:Exclude="[*]*Examples?%2c[*]*Startup"```

VSTS builds do not require double quotes to be unescaped:
```
dotnet test --configuration $(buildConfiguration) --no-build /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=cobertura /p:CoverletOutput=$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/TestResults/Coverage/ /p:Exclude="[MyAppName.DebugHost]*%2c[MyAppNamet.WebHost]*%2c[MyAppName.App]*"
```

## Note for Linux users

[There is an issue with MSBuild on Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/3468) affects the ability to escape quotes while specifying multiple comma-separated values. Linux MSBuild automatically translates `\` to `/` in properties, tasks, etc. before using them, which means if you specified `/p:CoverletOutputFormat=\"json,opencover\"` in an MSBuild script, it will be converted to `/p:CoverletOutputFormat=/"json,opencover/"` before execution. This yields an error similar to the following:

```text
MSBUILD : error MSB1006: Property is not valid. [/home/vsts/work/1/s/default.proj]
  Switch: opencover/
```

You'll see this if directly consuming Linux MSBuild or if using the Azure DevOps `MSBuild` task on a Linux agent.

The workaround is to use the .NET Core `dotnet msbuild` command instead of using MSBuild directly. The issue is not present in `dotnet msbuild` and the script will run with correctly escaped quotes.

## SourceLink

Coverlet supports [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) custom debug information contained in PDBs. When you specify the `--use-source-link` flag in the global tool or `/p:UseSourceLink=true` property in the MSBuild command, Coverlet will generate results that contain the URL to the source files in your source control instead of absolute file paths.
